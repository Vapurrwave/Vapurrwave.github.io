I’m currently experimenting with hosting a static html site on Github, but using the formatting restrictions of the Gemini protocol. 

no Javascript (or any other codes which intergrates with html, like CSS), 

no headers, 

no bold/italic/underline/etc…, 

no mixing tags in a way that breaks Gemini logic (like mixing a h1/2/3 tag with a link tag),

no inserting images directly (with the src tag),

emoji/unicode is ok within the text,

bullet point tags, 

h1, h2, and h3 tags, 

pre-formatted text tags, 

blocknote tags, 

link tags.

That's it!
